# Achievements Round 3
## Author: Eli Ewa

### Notes

- All of my achievements are combined in this one project.
  1. Three components created -> TheHero, TheNav & TheFooter
    - Font colors and background colors are handled with v-bind directive as per assignment instructions.
  2. I implemented the Nuxt Icon Module into my assignment and used it to add the "thunderbolt" logo to the nav -> TheNav.vue line 5. I finf the Nuxt Icon module to be very useful since it gives me access to thousands of different useful icons for free and without any hassle.
